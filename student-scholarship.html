<h2>Joint Call for Student Scholarship Applications and Student Volunteers</h2>

<h3>Student volunteer program</h3>

<p>We seek a limited number of student volunteers for the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. In exchange for one full day's work, each student volunteer will receive free registration to the conference (<strike>although not to the tutorials and workshops</strike> all days included) and a volunteer t-shirt. The work will be divided, probably into two half-day shifts, and the shifts will be scheduled to maximize volunteer access to the conference events. Tasks will include assisting at the registration desk, stuffing delegate packs, and providing assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops.</p>

<h3>Student scholarshop program</h3>

<p>Through the Student Scholarship Program, we will offer approximately 10 grants to assist student participants both with travel to Copenhagen for EMNLP 2017, as well as with conference expenses (such as housing, local transportation to/from airport, conference registration of non-main session events, reasonable food costs, etc.)</p>

<p>Successful applicants for the Student Scholarship Program must also participate in the Student Volunteer Program, and will receive free registration to the main conference in addition to their scholarships. Please note that these scholarships are to subsidize student participation in EMNLP 2017, and are not intended to cover all travel and conference expenses. The final amount of the scholarship will vary depending on the number of days of the stay, the cost of the travel, the quantity of money available, and the number and type of applicants.</p>

<h3>Selection criteria</h3>

<p>Applicants for both the Student Volunteer Program and the Student Scholarship Program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages (see below for the submission requirements). Preference will be given to students who are presenting a paper in the main conference or any of the associated workshops and do not have other means of travel support.</p>

<h3>Submission procedure</h3>

<p>Applicants for either the Student Volunteer Program or the Student Scholarship Program must be full-time students and should submit a justification and a one-page CV. Â  The applications are made through softconf <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2017/student_volunteer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Students should make travel arrangements, accommodation and registration independent of the results of their application. All Student Scholarship and Student Volunteer Award recipients must also register for the conference, selecting "I am a Student Volunteer" in the main conference section.</p>


<p>Students will be reimbursed after the conference and upon providing original receipts and an accounting of the requested funding (i.e., a business expense report).</p>

<p>TIMELINE</p>

<p>Application deadline: July 21, 2017</p>

<p>Notification of acceptance: Aug 4, 2017</p>


<p>Note: Applicants who are not selected for the Student Volunteer Program or the Student Scholarship Program must register early to receive reduced rates.</p>
