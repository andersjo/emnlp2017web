  <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
  <p><a href="http://sigdat.org">SIGDAT</a>, the <a href="http://www.aclweb.org">Association for Computational Linguistics</a> special interest group on linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP, invites you to participate in EMNLP 2017.</p>

  <p>The conference will be held on September 7–11, 2017 in Copenhagen, Denmark.
  The conference includes three days of full paper presentations and invited talks (September 9-11),
  plus two days consisting of workshops and tutorials (September 7-8).</p>

  <p>The conference web site will continue to be updated with information on workshops, tutorials, venue, traveling, etc.
  For helpful tips on visiting Copenhagen, Denmark, please check the WikiTravel website.</p>

  <p>The conference invites the submission of long and short papers related to empirical methods in natural language processing. Accepted papers will be presented as oral talks or posters. As in recent years, the conference will also include presentations of selected papers accepted by the <a href="http://www.transacl.org/">Transactions of the ACL</a>.

  <p>We invite you to join us!</p>

  <h3>Submission Information</h3>

  <p>We will be accepting submissions online via Softconf. The submission deadline is April 14, 2017.</p>

  <h3>Long Papers</h3>

  <p>EMNLP 2017 long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Each long paper submission consists of a paper of up to <strong>eight (8) pages of content, plus two pages for references</strong>; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to nine pages with unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.</p>

  <h3>Short Papers</h3>

  <p>EMNLP 2017 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. While a short paper is not a shortened long paper, the characteristics of short papers include: a small, focused contribution; work in progress; a negative result; an opinion piece; an interesting application nugget. Each short paper submission consists of up to <strong>four (4) pages of content, plus 2 pages for references</strong>; final versions of short papers will be given one additional page (up to five pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.</p>

  <h3>Formatting</h3>

  <p>Both long and short papers should follow the two-column format to be provided at the conference site. We reserve the right to reject submissions if the paper does not conform to these styles, including paper size and font size restrictions.</p>

  <h3>General Notes</h3>

  <p>As the reviewing will be blind, papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed ...”. Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the online submission process.</p>

  <p>EMNLP 2017 encourages submitting software and data that is described in the paper as supplementary material. EMNLP 2017 also encourages reporting preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the exact replication of the experiments described in the paper. Papers may be accompanied by supplementary material, consisting of software, data, pseudo-code, detailed proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, parameter specifications, and sample inputs and outputs for a system. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material.</p>

  <h3>Multiple Submission Policy</h3>

  <p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by EMNLP 2017. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2017 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.

  <p>Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and workshops that do not have published proceedings are not considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The submitted version should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: "The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version." Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.</p>

  <h3>Presentation requirement</h3>

  <p>All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2017. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs based on the nature rather than the quality of the work). There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.</p>

  <h3>People</h3>

  <p>The general chair of of EMNLP 2017 is Martha Palmer (University of Colorado).
     Program co-chairs are Sebastian Riedel (University College London) and
     Rebecca Hwa (University of Pittsburgh).
