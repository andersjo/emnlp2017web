<h2>Social event</h2>

<h4>When and where?</h4>

<p>
  The social event will take place in the court yard just outside the venue, directly after the last session of Sunday.
  It's scheduled to end at 10 PM.
</p>

<h4>What's the plan?</h4>

<p>
Some social events are designed to give attendees a chance to see a popular tourist attraction,
but this year, the social event is pure fun and relaxation.
All attendees are invited to grab free food at our food trucks, listen to great music, or just chill in the lounge areas
</p>

<h4>I like fun and excitement! Tell me about the surprises.</h4>

<p>Of course the social event <em>will</em> include surprises.</p>
<p>But - hey, theyâ€™re surprises.</p>
