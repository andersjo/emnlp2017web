    A modern youth hostel, with clean, functional, but cozy rooms.
    Prices are DKK 800-900 for a single or double room.
    The hostel is located right next to the Langebro bridge over the canal,
    with a stunning view of the entire city (it is one of the few high rises here).
    Across the bridge is Islands Brygge, one of the up-and-coming neighborhoods,
    which also hosts the Havnebadet (canal bath), a popular spot for BBQs, sunbathing, and cooling off in the canal.
    The conference center is about a 15min walk (1.2km) away.
