      <div class="speaker-name">Dan Jurafsky, Stanford University</div>
      <span class="card-title">"Does This Vehicle Belong to You”? <br/>Processing the Language of Policing for Improving Police-Community Relations</span>
      <div class="abstract">Abstract TBA</div>
      <div class="bio">Dan Jurafsky is Professor and Chair of Linguistics and Professor
  of Computer Science, at Stanford University.  His research has
  focused on the extraction of meaning, intention, and affect from
  text and speech, on the processing of Chinese, and on applying
  natural language processing to the cognitive and social sciences.
  Dan's deep interest in NLP education led him to co-write with Jim
  Martin the widely-used textbook "Speech and Language Processing”
  (whose 3rd edition is in (slow) progress) and co-teach with Chris Manning
  the first massive open online class on natural language processing.
  Dan was the recipient of the 2002 MacArthur Fellowship and is a
  2015 James Beard Award Nominee for his book, "The Language of Food:
  A Linguist Reads the Menu".</div>

      <div class="speaker-name">Sharon Goldwater, University of Edinburgh</div>
      <span class="card-title">Language learning in humans and machines: making connections to make progress</span>
      <div class="abstract">Abstract TBA</div>
      <div class="bio">Sharon Goldwater is a Reader at the University of Edinburgh's
  School of Informatics, where she is a member of the Institute for
  Language, Cognition and Computation. She received her PhD in 2007
  from Brown University and spent two years as a postdoctoral
  researcher at Stanford University before moving to Edinburgh. Her
  research interests include unsupervised learning for speech and
  language processing, computer modelling of language acquisition
  in children, and computational studies of language
  use. Dr. Goldwater co-chaired the 2014 Conference of the European
  Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and is
  Chair-Elect of EACL. She has served on the editorial boards of
  the Transactions of the Association for Computational
  Linguistics, the Computational Linguistics journal, and OPEN
  MIND: Advances in Cognitive Science (a new open-access
  journal). In 2016, she received the Roger Needham Award from the
  British Computer Society, awarded for "distinguished research
  contribution in computer science by a UK-based researcher who has
  completed up to 10 years of post-doctoral research."</div>

      <div class="bio">
        I was born in Zimbabwe, with malaria. I was a refugee from the war in Mocambique and thanks to my parents getting in debt to buy me a passport from a corrupt official, I grew up in Portugal without water and electricity, before the EU got there, and without my parents who were busy making money to pay their debt. At 8, I joined my parents in Venezuela and began school in the hood; see City of God. I moved to South Africa after high-school and sold beer illegally in black-townships for a living until 1991. Apartheid was the worst thing I ever experienced. I did my BSc in electrical engineering and MSc in control at the University of the Witwatersrand, where I strived to be the best student to prove to racists that anyone can do it. I did my PhD on Bayesian methods for neural networks at Trinity College, Cambridge University. I did a postdoc in Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley. I became a Full Professor at the University of British Columbia, before joining the University of Oxford in 2013. I quit Oxford in 2017 to join DeepMind full-time, where I lead the Machine Learning team. I aim to solve intelligence so that future generations have a better life. I have been a Senior Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research for a long time. Some of my recent awards, mostly thanks to my collaborators, include:
        Best Paper Award at the International Conference on Machine Learning (2016),
        Best Paper Award at the International Conference on Learning Representations (2016),
        Winner of round 5 of the Yelp Dataset Challenge (2015),
        Distinguished Paper Award at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2013),
        Charles A. McDowell Award for Excellence in Research (2012), and
        Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems Young Researcher Award (2010).
