      <div class="speaker-name">Dan Jurafsky, Stanford University</div>
      <span class="card-title">"Does This Vehicle Belong to You”? <br/>Processing the Language of Policing for Improving Police-Community Relations</span>
      <div class="abstract">Abstract TBA</div>
      <div class="bio">Dan Jurafsky is Professor and Chair of Linguistics and Professor
  of Computer Science, at Stanford University.  His research has
  focused on the extraction of meaning, intention, and affect from
  text and speech, on the processing of Chinese, and on applying
  natural language processing to the cognitive and social sciences.
  Dan's deep interest in NLP education led him to co-write with Jim
  Martin the widely-used textbook "Speech and Language Processing”
  (whose 3rd edition is in (slow) progress) and co-teach with Chris Manning
  the first massive open online class on natural language processing.
  Dan was the recipient of the 2002 MacArthur Fellowship and is a
  2015 James Beard Award Nominee for his book, "The Language of Food:
  A Linguist Reads the Menu".</div>

      <div class="bio">Sharon Goldwater is a Reader at the University of Edinburgh's
  School of Informatics, where she is a member of the Institute for
  Language, Cognition and Computation. She received her PhD in 2007
  from Brown University and spent two years as a postdoctoral
  researcher at Stanford University before moving to Edinburgh. Her
  research interests include unsupervised learning for speech and
  language processing, computer modelling of language acquisition
  in children, and computational studies of language
  use. Dr. Goldwater co-chaired the 2014 Conference of the European
  Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and is
  Chair-Elect of EACL. She has served on the editorial boards of
  the Transactions of the Association for Computational
  Linguistics, the Computational Linguistics journal, and OPEN
  MIND: Advances in Cognitive Science (a new open-access
  journal). In 2016, she received the Roger Needham Award from the
  British Computer Society, awarded for "distinguished research
  contribution in computer science by a UK-based researcher who has
  completed up to 10 years of post-doctoral research."</div>
