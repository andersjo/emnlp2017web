<h2>Instructions for authors</h2>

<p>We have freshly updated (July 7, 2017) the paper templates,
  which must be used for the camera ready submissions.
</p>
<p>
  Get them below.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/downloads/emnlp2017-word.docx">Word template</a></li>
  <li><a href="/downloads/emnlp17-latex.zip">LaTeX template</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that authors observe the format requirement; please do not alter the templates and do not use LaTeX commands to alter the spacings around headers and margins.</p>
<p>In the final camera ready copy, authors are allowed one additional page from their submission drafts to address concerns raised by the reviewers. That is, a long paper can have up to nine (9) pages of content with unlimited pages for references, and a short paper can have up to five (5) pages of content with unlimited pages for references. </p>
<p>The camera ready files should be submitted via Softconf.</p>
<p>The deadline is <b>July 21, 2017</b></p>
